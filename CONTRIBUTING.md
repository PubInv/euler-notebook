# Contributing to Euler Notebook

If you are interested in contributing to Euler Notebook, contact [Robert L. Read](mailto:read.robert@gmail.com), the founder of Public Invention, and ask for access to the #euler-notebook Slack channel.
Please join the conversation!

If course, you may fork the repository, make some improvements, and send us a pull request.
However, we recommend that you discuss it on the Slack channel first to ensure you are not duplicating work.

Public Invention requires all contributors to assign copyright to Public Invention.
To make Euler Notebook more widely available and to create a source of revenue to reinvest into the development of Euler Notebook,
Public Invention may operate Euler Notebook as a paid service in the future,
or may [multi-license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-licensing) Euler Notebook to 3rd-parties.
Public Invention is a non-profit corporation, so no individuals may receive [private benefit](https://boardsource.org/resources/private-benefit-private-inurement-self-dealing/).

Currently, David Jeschke is BDFN ("Benevolent Dictator For Now") and Public Invention "Project Coach".
We hope to move to a more democratic and meritocratic governance if the number of active, ongoing contributors can justify it.

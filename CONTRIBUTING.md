# Contributing to Math Tablet

If you are interested in contributing to Math Tablet, contact [Robert L. Read](mailto:read.robert@gmail.com), the founder of Public Invention, and ask for access to the #math-tablet Slack channel. Please join the conversation!

If course, you may fork the repository, make some improvements, and send us a pull request. However, we recommend that you discuss it on the Slack channel first to ensure you are not duplicating work.

Currently, David Jeschke is BDFN ("Benevolent Dictator For Now") and Public Invention "Project Coach". We hope to move to a more democratic and meritocratic governance if the number of active, ongoing contributors can justify it.

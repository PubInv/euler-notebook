# Layout Test

This is an experiment to see what a completed euler-notebook notebook might look like.

Open index.html locally in a browser, or:

```bash
~/euler-notebook/experiments/layout-test$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then navigate to `http://computername.local:8000/` in a browser on another device on the same network,
where `computername` is the Computer Name shown in the Sharing panel of System Preferences on OS X.

You can append `?d=1` to the URL to see a debug view which colors the various elements so you can see their extents.
